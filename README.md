# list-palette
## A cheklist app for the enthusiastic optimizer 

How many times have you written a grocery list, or made a packing list for a trip?  We end up writing the same things down over and over, and each time we have to really focus to make sure we don't forget something.  

But what if our lists were efficient to re-use?  

List-palette delivers on this idea by letting you save your lists for later and mix component lists together to make new lists when the time comes to shop, pack, or plan your day.  

A quick example:  
You're planning to buy groceries and you intend to make tacos tonight.  You've made tacos before, so you already have that list of ingredients saved.  But you also need your staples, the items you always check on before you shop: butter, milk, beverage, breakfast items.  And then there's that bulk item that you realized you are almost out of.  Salt! 

With ListPalette, you put today's shopping list together by: 
1. Creating a new list
2. Adding your tacos recipe
3. Adding your staples 
4. Adding salt

When you're done shopping, you delete this list: it was for one-time use.  But you still have your tacos and staples lists on-hand for next time. 

Of course, I couldn't stop there because we all know that grocery stores have sections.  To fit with reality, your lists can have sub-lists so when you're in the produce section, you see the produce you need, and not the flour.
